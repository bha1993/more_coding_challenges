# more_coding_challenges

Part 1 (see Search.java and SearchTests.java):

Write search algorithm that finds location j in the array such that all elements in range A[0] … A[j-1] are strictly less than x and all elements in range A[j] … A[n-1] are greater than or equal to x (x doesn’t have to exist in A). Returns -1 if no suitable location is found. MUST run in O(log n) time.

Given an array A of N integers (where elements of A are not necessarily unique and sorted in ascending order). Given target integer x.

I also included a test suite.
